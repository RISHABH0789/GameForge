    <h2>Educational Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      Educational games are designed to teach while entertaining.
      Unlike traditional games that primarily focus on fun, these prioritize learning outcomes, whether academic (math, language, science) or practical skills (typing, memory, logic).
      The challenge is usually structured around interactive quizzes, puzzles, and real-world problem-solving but wrapped in game mechanics that keep the learner motivated.
      Gamification—progress bars, achievements, and rewards—turns learning into an engaging experience.
      They’re popular among younger audiences but can also be powerful for adults learning new skills.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
