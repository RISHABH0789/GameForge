    <h2>Action Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
    Action games are one of the oldest and most fundamental genres in gaming, often serving as the “default” style when people think of video games.
    These games test a player’s reflexes, timing, and precision under high-pressure scenarios.
    The gameplay typically involves fast-paced movement, quick reaction to enemies or obstacles, and mastery of combat mechanics.
    Unlike slower, strategy-heavy genres, action games are designed to keep adrenaline high, often putting players into situations where split-second decisions determine victory or failure.
    They can bepurely combat-oriented, like hack-and-slash or beat ‘em ups, or combine platforming challenges with combat.
    Action games are also known for their variety—ranging from side-scrollers, 3D adventure titles, to open-world action-packed sagas.
