    <h2>Fighting Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      Fighting games focus on direct, often one-on-one, close combat between characters with unique fighting styles.
      The genre emphasizes precision, memorization, and strategy—learning combos, timing attacks, and predicting an opponent’s moves.
      Competitive fighting games thrive in esports, where high-level players demonstrate skill through advanced mechanics like frame-perfect inputs and combo execution.
      They are also known for their iconic characters, detailed animations, and unique special moves.
      This genre is both beginner-friendly (easy fun in casual matches) and extremely deep at professional levels.
