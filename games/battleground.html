    <h2>Battle Royale Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
       Battle Royale games combine survival, exploration, and scavenging mechanics with large-scale multiplayer competition.
       Typically, dozens to hundreds of players are dropped into a shrinking map with limited resources.
       The primary goal is to be the last person or team standing. Players must adapt quickly—scavenge weapons, armor, and supplies—while keeping an eye on the ever-decreasing safe zone that forces encounters and prevents long-term hiding.
       The thrill comes from unpredictability: no two matches are the same because loot, enemy encounters, and safe zones change constantly.
       This genre exploded in popularity because of its mix of competitive tension, social teamwork, and replayability.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
