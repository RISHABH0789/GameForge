    <h2>Tactical Role-Playing Games (TRPGs)</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      TRPGs merge turn-based strategy with RPG character progression.
      Battles occur on grid-based maps where positioning and tactics matter as much as character levels.
      Outside combat, players grow their team, manage equipment, and engage in story-driven narratives.
      They are slower-paced but deeply strategic, rewarding long-term planning and team synergy.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
      <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fire-emblem-three-houses-switch/">Fire Emblem-Three Houses:</a>Combines tactical combat with deep character relationships.
