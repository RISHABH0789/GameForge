    <h2>Visual Novels</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      Visual novels are story-driven games that resemble interactive books with static or lightly animated visuals.
      The focus is on dialogue and branching narratives where player choices determine the ending.
      They often explore romance, mystery, or psychological themes.
      Visual novels are popular in Japan and have gained worldwide recognition for their emotional depth and unique storytelling style.
