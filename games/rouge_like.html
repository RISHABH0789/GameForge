    <h2>Roguelike Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      Roguelikes emphasize difficulty, randomness, and replayability.
      Every run is different, thanks to procedurally generated levels, loot, and enemy placements.
      Permadeath is a key feature—once a character dies, progress resets, forcing players to start over with new strategies.
      This makes each attempt meaningful and tense, as players juggle risk and reward.
      Roguelikes encourage experimentation and mastery, rewarding persistence over time.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/">The Binding of Isaac:</a>A dark, dungeon-crawling roguelike with near-infinite replayability.
