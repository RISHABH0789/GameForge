    <h2>Survival Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      Survival games drop players into hostile environments with minimal resources.
      The challenge is to endure—maintaining health, hunger, stamina, and often sanity.
      Crafting is a major feature: players must create tools, shelters, and weapons to survive.
      Enemies may be wildlife, other players, or supernatural threats.
      These games are open-ended, with no set win condition—the goal is simply to keep going as long as possible.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
