    <h2>Platformer Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
       Platformers are built around navigating environments filled with platforms, obstacles, and traps.
      Jumping, running, and timing are the core mechanics.
      The genre is one of the earliest in gaming history, with icons like Mario defining it.
      Platformers can be 2D or 3D, linear or open-world.
      The charm lies in precision—every jump, movement, and landing matters.
      They range from lighthearted family-friendly adventures to brutally difficult “hardcore” platformers that test patience and skill.
