    <h2>Interactive Fiction</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      Interactive fiction (IF) is the purest storytelling genre in games, often using text as the primary medium.
      Players navigate stories by reading passages and making choices that branch the narrative.
      It emphasizes imagination—players picture the world in their mind rather than through graphics.
      Modern IF may include visuals, but the heart remains text-driven.
      Replayability is high because different decisions lead to vastly different outcomes.
      Fans of books and storytelling often gravitate toward this genre.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
