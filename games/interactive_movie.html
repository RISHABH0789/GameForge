    <h2>Interactive Movie Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
       Interactive movies blur the line between cinema and gaming, emphasizing storytelling over traditional mechanics.
      These games present players with movie-like visuals and narratives where choices shape the outcome.
      Instead of skill-based combat, the tension often comes from dialogue choices, quick-time events, or branching paths.
      The goal is immersion—players feel like they are living inside a film where their decisions matter.
      They’re perfect for players who enjoy narrative-driven experiences and emotional storytelling.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
