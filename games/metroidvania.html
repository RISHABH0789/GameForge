    <h2>Metroidvania</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      Metroidvania games are a sub-genre of action-adventure that emphasize exploration and progression through acquiring new abilities.
      Players often start weak and gradually gain powers (like double jump, wall climbing, or special attacks) that unlock previously inaccessible areas.
      These games reward curiosity and patience, as the world is interconnected and nonlinear.
      Backtracking with new abilities uncovers secrets, shortcuts, and hidden bosses.
      The genre is beloved for its sense of discovery and rewarding skill-based progression.
