    <h2>MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games)</h2><br>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
       MMORPGs are vast online worlds where thousands of players coexist.
      Players create characters, progress through levels, complete quests, and interact socially with others.
      Unlike single-player RPGs, MMORPGs thrive on community—guilds, trading, raiding, and player-vs-player battles create a shared, living world.
      They’re long-term experiences, often requiring years of dedication, and are continually updated with expansions.
      These games mix exploration, story, and progression with strong social bonds.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
