    <h2>Sandbox Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      Sandbox games emphasize freedom and creativity.
      Instead of linear missions, they provide tools and environments for players to shape their own experiences.
      There are usually no strict goals—players can build, explore, or simply experiment.
      Sandbox games encourage imagination and experimentation, often leading to emergent gameplay where unexpected stories unfold naturally.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe">Minecraft:</a>The ultimate sandbox, letting players build anything from simple huts to massive cities.
