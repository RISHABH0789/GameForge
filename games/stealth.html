    <h2>Stealth Games</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      Stealth games challenge players to complete objectives while avoiding detection.
      Rather than brute force, success depends on patience, timing, and cleverness.
      Players sneak past guards, disable security systems, and use the environment to remain hidden.
      Many games mix stealth with action, but pure stealth titles reward players who never get spotted.
      The tension of being one mistake away from failure creates a unique atmosphere.
