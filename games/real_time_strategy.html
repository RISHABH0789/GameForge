    <h2>Real-Time Strategy (RTS)</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
       RTS games revolve around resource gathering, base building, and unit management in real time.
      Unlike turn-based strategy, everything happens simultaneously, requiring multitasking, quick decision-making, and strategic foresight.
      Players must balance economy, defense, and offense while predicting opponents’ moves.
      RTS games appeal to tactical thinkers who thrive on pressure.
      They are especially popular in competitive scenes where micro (unit control) and macro (economy management) separate great players from casual ones.
      <br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
      <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/starcraft-ii">StarCraft II:</a>Famous for its fast-paced, competitive RTS gameplay.
