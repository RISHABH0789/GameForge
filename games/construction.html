    <h2>Construction and Management Simulation</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
      These games put the player into the role of designer, architect, or manager.
      Instead of focusing on combat or reflexes, the challenge comes from planning, resource management, and efficiency.
      Players often start with limited resources and must expand or sustain their project, whether it’s a city, business, theme park, or even a farm.
      Success requires long-term thinking, balancing multiple systems like economy, environment, and people’s happiness.
      This genre appeals to players who enjoy problem-solving, optimization, and creativity rather than high-stakes combat.
